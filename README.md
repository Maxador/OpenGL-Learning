# OpenGL Learning with Go
This repository is a place for me to learn how to use OpenGL in the Go
programing language

## Dependencies
I used go-gl/gl package to run OpenGL 4.1 and go-gl/glfw for window management
(GLFW v3.1) with OpenGL.
```
go get github.com/go-gl/gl/v4.1-core/gl
go get github.com/go-gl/glfw/v3.1/glfw
```
